			<h1>David Brodsky</h1>

			<p><b>Hello!</b> I spend my time writing software to advance practical efforts that better society. I built <a href="https://www.openwatch.net">OpenWatch</a>, a suite of open-source tools for participatory journalism, with <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou">Rich</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrisballinger/">Chris</a>. OpenWatch was my first experience with incorporation (and re-incorporation), raising investment, and pitching to large clients.
<p>We poured an immense ammount of energy into creating OpenWatch's Android/iOS live video streaming platform. Why did such a fundamental feature have to be such a pain to implement? Thus, <a href="https://kickflip.io">Kickflip</a> was born: A turnkey SaaS product that handles all the plumbing for a cloud video application.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://kickflip.io">Kickflip</a> <span class="pull-right"><small>8/2013 - Present</small></span></h3>
			<h4>Co-Founder. Android Developer</h4>
			<p>I designed and implemented an open-source <a href="https://github.com/Kickflip/kickflip-android-sdk">live streaming SDK for Android</a> that integrates with a SaaS product I designed with my OpenWatch Co-Founders.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://openwatch.net">OpenWatch</a> <span class="pull-right"><small>11/2012 - Present</small></span></h3>
			<h4>Co-Founder. Android Developer and DevOps</h4>
			<p>I helped steer an idea through incorporation, fundraising, and tons of iteration.</p>
			<p>I developed Android applications (<a href="https://github.com/OpenWatch/OpenWatch-Android">OpenWatch</a>, <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/UnitedAgainst1070">Stop SB 1070</a>, <a href="https://www.aclu-nj.org/yourrights/the-app-place/">Police Tape</a>) that reliably transmit media from mobile phones to our CDN.</p>
			<p>I developed a DevOps strategy for our application servers and implemented it with Chef.</p>

			<h3>Freelance Web and Android Engineer <span class="pull-right"><small>11/2011 - Present</small></span></h3>
			<p>I perform DevOps, Django, and Android development for hire.</p>

			<h3>Engineer <span class="pull-right"><small>11/2010 - 11/2011</small></span></h3>
			<p>I helped plan PPL's high voltage transmission network in Pennsylvania. I taught myself Python and employed it to help forecast the demand for electricity across the grid.</p>
