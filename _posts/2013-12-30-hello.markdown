After writing in a beefy Django-powered app and perpetually losing my database I decided to try out [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

Jekyll uses the [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) templating library, which feels familiar coming from Django. In a nutshell, you layout your HTML/CSS/Liquid pages and provide content in markdown files. Jekyll then completes all possible renderings in a single build process, whereas Django renders each page for each request (before caching). That comes at the cost of dynamism: e.g There's no great way to search this thing (besides loading the whole contents into memory and searching with Javascript). BUT THERE'S NO DATABASE, and now the main possible attack is breaking ssh+git instead of my weakly guarded django admin portal.

Oh, and [SGit for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.sheimi.sgit) is a *pretty* full-featured Git client that lets me push posts from my phone! (Currently trying to figure out how to make the ssh clone feature work. Though https + user auth works for now). A quick search doesn't turn up any push-capable iOS clients but [objective-git](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git) suggests it's possible.
